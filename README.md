Mechantronics-Project

The main goal of this project was to create a car that uses uses three ultrasonic sensors, positioned at the front, -45, and +45 degrees, to stop when an object is in its way and perform a pass on either side or stand still if all sensors are blocked. Within the code, you will notice a state system and a sub state system. The state system is responsible for the following states: Idle, cruise, stop_decide, and pass_exec. These states are determined by raw sensor data that has been converted into distances. For example, if the  front threshold distance is not met and niether of the side sensors detect anything within the specified range, the car will enter the cruise state. However, when an objet is detected by one or more sensors, the code will switch to its sub-state where it performs a pass execution based on what sensors are blocked. This sub state is very important because it allows the car to perform a full pass without the code overiding once the front or side sensors become clear.
